{"name":"microPascal Compiler","tagline":"A project microPascal compiler written in Haskell.","body":"### Overview\r\nThis is a [microPascal](http://hypertextbookshop.com/transPL/Resources/microPascalCFG.html) compiler that is written in the Haskell programming language. It's a project compiler for the computer science capstone course at [Montana State University](http://www.cs.montana.edu/course/csci-468). A group of three CS students created this, [Murph Murphy](https://github.com/skeet70/), [James Sonntag](https://github.com/Gabrinthei/), and [Tyler Huffman](https://github.com/iduhetonas/).\r\n\r\n### Objectives\r\nOur main objective for this project was to expand our abilities. Up to this point we have had a mostly imperative programming experience at the school, and wanted to use this opportunity to learn about functional programming as well as compilers.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
